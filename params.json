{"name":"tsgen","body":"## Welcome to tsgen project!\r\n\r\n**tsgen** is an R package that provide tools for time series data generation. It's aimed to generate series of demand, i.e., quantity of a product sold, and than add seasonality and response to price to it.\r\n\r\n## Quick start:\r\n\r\n### Step 1\r\nDownload **tsgen** source from [this](https://github.com/jdanielnd/tsgen/downloads) page and install it:\r\n\r\n    $ R CMD INSTALL tsgen_1.0.tar.gz\r\n\r\nThat's it! You have just installed the package. Follow the next steps to generate some example data.\r\n\r\n### Step 2\r\n\r\nGenerate a basic time series, based on some **key points**. It will use the loess fit to generate points between your key points, interpolating the series.\r\n\r\n    library(tsgen)\r\n    kp <- c(100,110,140,130,115)\r\n    bs <- basic.series(kp,start=c(2009,1))\r\n\r\n### Step 3\r\n\r\nAdd **seasonality** to the basic series. This seasonality can be either additive or multiplicative. In this case we will use a multiplicative seasonality, with normal distribution with standard deviation equals to 0.08\r\n\r\n    bss <- add.season(bs, s.sd=0.08)\r\n\r\n### Step 4\r\n\r\nAdd a price response to the series, given a price variation and a price elasticity of demand. In this case our prices will be generated via loess interpolation, like we did for the quantity.\r\n\r\n    bssp <- add.price(bss, elast=-2, p.vec=c(6,8,7,6))\r\n\r\nAnd that's it! So we have generated 3 objects:\r\n\r\n* bs - basic series. It doesn't have seasonality or price response, and will be used as a basis for building other series.\r\n* bss - basic series with seasonality.\r\n* bssp - basic series with seasonality and price response. It's actually a list with the series value with seasonality and price, the generated values for the price and the generated values for elasticity (or a unique value, depending on whether you input on value or a vector to be interpolated).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis package was idealised by Claudio Duarte and written by @jdanielnd. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the package?
